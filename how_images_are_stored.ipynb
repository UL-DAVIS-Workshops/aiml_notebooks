    "\n",
    "Images, like all pieces of data, are actually just broken down into a bunch of numbers. Instead of thinking of an entire image as “one piece of data”, think about each pixel of an image representing a number between 0 and 255. The number depends on how much the pixel’s color contributes to the image. Then when you have an entire image (let’s say 120x120 pixels), you have a 120x120 matrix of data, like so:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a black and white photo. See how the super black pixels are 255, and the whitespace is all 0's?\n",
    "With colored photos, it’s the same idea, but this time you have three layers on top of each other — a red, green, and blue layer. Each pixel is still a number from 0–255. Now you have a 120x120x3 matrix:\n",
